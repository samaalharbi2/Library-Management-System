# Library Management System (Database Design and Implementation)

## Overview:
The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage the large volume of data associated with daily library operations. The system is based on an Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD) to represent the complex relationships between different data entities. The EERD serves as the foundation for creating an organized and optimized database schema, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Additionally, normalization techniques were applied to the database schema to eliminate redundancy and enhance data consistency.

The project involves implementing the database using **MySQL**, along with SQL queries and data modeling to ensure efficient data management for library resources and operations.

## Skills Acquired:
- **MySQL**: Gained proficiency in designing and developing databases using MySQL, writing SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **EERD Design**: Developed and implemented an Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EERD) to represent the relationships between various data entities in the system.
- **Database Normalization**: Applied normalization techniques to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data consistency across the database.
- **Data Modeling**: Utilized data modeling principles to design a robust and efficient database structure.
- **Collaboration**: Worked as part of a team, distributing tasks and coordinating efforts to deliver a cohesive and fully functional system.
- **Project Management**: Improved project management skills by organizing development tasks and ensuring deadlines were met while maintaining high-quality work.

## Features:
- Efficient management of library books, members, and staff data.
- Search functionality to quickly find books and members.
- A system for tracking book loans and returns.
- A report generation feature for library usage and statistics.
- Data consistency ensured through normalization and SQL queries.

## Technologies Used:
- **MySQL**: For database creation and management.
- **SQL**: To handle data operations such as insert, update, delete, and select queries.
- **EERD**: For designing the database structure and ensuring relationships between entities.
